# VideoAnalysis

A standalone application for creating visualizations and extracting motion features from video files.

## Features

- Create various visualizations from a video file: motiongrams, motion images, motion history images, etc.
- Open individual video files or batch-process folders of files
- Basic pre-processing: cropping, trimming
- Extract some basic motion features: quantity of motion, centroid of motion, area of motion
- Realtime preview of visualizations

Please see the [tutorial](https://github.com/fourMs/VideoAnalysis/wiki) for more information.

## History

This software project was started by [Alexander Refsum Jensenius](http://people.uio.no/alexanje) in 2003, first in the form of the [Musical Gestures Toolbox for Max](https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/research/labs/fourms/downloads/software/musicalgesturestoolbox/mgt-max/). The toolbox later became integrated as the first collection of video modules in the [Jamoma](http://www.jamoma.org) project. 

Many people found the video visualization tools useful, but they did not want to invest time in learning how to develop in Max. This led to the development of the standalone VideoAnalysis application based on modules from the MGT. Over the years, it has been used by a number of researchers and practitioners in fields such as music, dance, medicine, and physiotherapy. 

VideoAnalysis still aims to be a complete, standalone and user-friendly solution for video analysis and visualization. If you want more flexibility, you should check out [Jamoma](http://www.jamoma.org) (for Max) if you are interested in realtime analysis. For more powerful analysis tools, take a look at the [Musical Gestures Toolbox for Matlab](https://github.com/fourMs/MGT-matlab/) or [Musical Gestures Toolbox for Python](https://github.com/fourMs/MGT-python).
